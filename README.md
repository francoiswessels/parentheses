# parenthesis

Given an array containing opening and closing brackets, check whether the brackets are balanced in the array.

The solution works using standard libraries in Python. It was developed using Python 3.8.10, but the implementation should not be particularly sensitive to Python version (dequew as available as early as v3.1).

That run tests:

```
python3 -m unittest
```
